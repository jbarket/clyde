# Claude Development Environment

This project uses a modular configuration system. Read these files in order:

1. `.claude/generated.md` - Team standards and patterns (auto-generated)
2. `.claude/project.md` - Project-specific instructions  
3. `.claude/architecture.md` - How this project is organized

Always treat these files as authoritative extensions of this file.

## Configuration Management

- To update team standards: Edit `.claude/config.yaml` and run `clyde sync`
- To add project-specific rules: Edit `.claude/project.md`
- Generated files are marked with timestamps and should not be hand-edited

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Sync configuration (rebuild generated.md from current config)
clyde sync

# Add a new module
clyde sync --add react.patterns

# Remove a module  
clyde sync --remove docker

# Check what would change
clyde sync --check
```
