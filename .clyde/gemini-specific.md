# Gemini Research Integration Guidelines

## Research-First Development

### Pre-Implementation Research
Before implementing new features or technologies:
1. **Technology evaluation**: Research current best practices and alternatives
2. **Standards review**: Investigate industry standards and conventions
3. **Community feedback**: Check developer community discussions and feedback
4. **Performance analysis**: Research performance characteristics and benchmarks

### Research Query Patterns
```markdown
# Effective research queries for Gemini:
"What are the current best practices for React state management in 2024?"
"Compare authentication methods for Node.js APIs: JWT vs sessions vs OAuth"
"What are the latest security recommendations for database access in Python?"
"Research performance optimization techniques for large-scale web applications"
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Model Strategy Alignment
Use Gemini for research phase in multi-model workflows:
```bash
# Research Phase (Gemini)
1. Technology evaluation and comparison
2. Best practices investigation  
3. Standards and compliance research
4. Performance and security analysis

# Architecture Phase (Opus - if complex)
5. Design system architecture based on research

# Implementation Phase (Sonnet)
6. Implement using research-informed decisions
```

### Pre-PRD Research

3. Opus: Design architecture (if complex)
4. Sonnet: Implement feature
5. Sonnet: Write tests and documentation
```

```bash
# Research-informed debugging:
1. Gemini: Research known issues and solutions
2. Gemini: Investigate debugging techniques
3. Sonnet: Apply solutions and debug
4. Sonnet: Implement fixes and tests
```

2. Gemini: Evaluate integration approaches
3. Opus: Plan migration strategy (if complex)
4. Sonnet: Implement migration steps
5. Sonnet: Validate and test integration
```

# Gemini-Specific Formatting Guidelines

## Context File Integration

### File Import Syntax
Use proper Gemini import syntax for modular context:
```markdown
# Main context content here

@./path/to/specialized-guidelines.md
@./docs/api-standards.md
@./src/component-patterns.md

# Additional context after imports
```

### Hierarchical Context Structure
- **Global context**: `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md` for universal rules
- **Project context**: Project root `GEMINI.md` for project-wide standards  
- **Local context**: Subdirectory `GEMINI.md` files for component-specific rules

## Memory Management

### Context Refresh Commands
```bash
# Reload context after file changes
/memory refresh

# View current combined context
/memory show

# Check context file count (displayed in CLI footer)
```

### Context File Organization
```markdown
# Recommended GEMINI.md structure
## General Instructions
- Core development principles
- Code style preferences
- Framework conventions

## Specialized Guidelines
@./frontend/react-patterns.md
@./backend/api-guidelines.md
@./testing/test-standards.md

## Project-Specific Rules
- Version requirements
- Architecture decisions
- Deployment considerations
```

## Response Style for Gemini

### Structured Responses
Gemini works well with clearly structured responses:
```markdown
## Problem Analysis
[Brief analysis of the issue]

## Solution
[Step-by-step solution]

## Implementation
[Code or specific actions]

## Verification
[How to confirm success]
```

### Code Organization
Present code with clear context and purpose:
```javascript
// Feature: User Authentication
// Purpose: Secure login with JWT tokens
// Dependencies: express, jsonwebtoken

const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

function authenticateUser(req, res, next) {
    // Implementation with clear comments
    const token = req.header('Authorization');
    // ... rest of implementation
}
```

## Gemini-Specific Features

### Research Integration
Leverage Gemini's research capabilities:
- **Technology comparison**: "Compare React vs Vue for this use case"
- **Best practices**: "Research current Node.js security best practices"
- **Library evaluation**: "Find the best testing framework for Python"

### Multi-Modal Understanding
When working with visual content:
- Describe visual elements clearly
- Reference UI components specifically
- Explain visual relationships and layouts

### Web Context Integration
Utilize Gemini's web knowledge for:
- Current documentation and standards
- Recent technology updates
- Community best practices and trends

## Context File Best Practices

### Modular Organization
```markdown
# Core GEMINI.md
@./standards/code-style.md
@./standards/architecture.md
@./standards/testing.md

# Language-specific includes
@./languages/python-style.md
@./languages/javascript-patterns.md

# Framework-specific includes
@./frameworks/react-conventions.md
@./frameworks/fastapi-patterns.md
```

### Security Considerations
- Use relative paths for security: `@./path/file.md`
- Avoid absolute paths that could expose system structure
- Keep sensitive information out of context files
- Validate file permissions and access

### Version Control Integration
```gitignore
# .gitignore entries for Gemini context
.gemini/cache/
.gemini/temp/

# Keep committed:
GEMINI.md
.gemini/generated-*.md
.gemini/project-*.md
```

## Error Handling and Debugging

### Context Loading Issues
```markdown
# If imports fail:
1. Check file paths are relative: @./path/file.md
2. Verify file extensions are .md
3. Confirm files exist and are readable
4. Use /memory refresh to reload
```

### Circular Import Prevention
Gemini automatically handles circular imports, but structure to avoid:
```markdown
# Bad: Potential confusion
# file-a.md imports file-b.md
# file-b.md imports file-a.md

# Good: Clear hierarchy
# main.md imports specialized files
# specialized files don't import each other
```

## Integration with Clyde

### Generated Files
Clyde generates `.clyde/generated-gemini.md` specifically for Gemini with:
- Target-specific module content
- Proper import syntax
- Gemini-optimized formatting

### Configuration Management
```yaml
# .clyde/config.yaml
targets:
  - claude
  - gemini

# Automatically includes ai-specific.gemini.* modules
```

### Cross-Target Consistency
- Share core principles across all targets
- Use AI-specific modules for unique features
- Maintain consistent terminology and standards
- Coordinate updates across target files
