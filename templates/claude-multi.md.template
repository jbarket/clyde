# Claude Development Environment

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Read configuration files BEFORE any work**

MANDATORY: Before responding to ANY request, you MUST read these files in order:

1. **`.clyde/generated-claude.md`** - Main coordination file (read this first)
2. **Read ALL files referenced** in the generated-claude.md file 
3. **`.clyde/project-claude.md`** - Project-specific instructions
4. **`.clyde/architecture.md`** - Project organization

**IMPORTANT:** The generated-claude.md file will list additional files you must read. Read each one using the Read tool. These files contain ALL team standards and override any defaults. They are AUTHORITATIVE.**

## Multi-AI Support
This project is configured for multiple AI assistants: {{targets|join(', ')}}

Each AI has its own generated context file:
{% for target in targets -%}
- {{target.title()}}: `.clyde/generated-{{target}}.md`
{% endfor %}

## Configuration Management

```bash
# Sync configuration (rebuild generated files from current config)
clyde sync

# Sync only Claude target
clyde sync --target claude

# Add a new module
clyde sync --add react.patterns

# Remove a module  
clyde sync --remove docker

# Check what would change
