# Complex Task Management Strategy

## Task Management Hierarchy

### Preference Order for Task Management
1. **PRD + Taskmaster AI** - For complex, multi-step development tasks
2. **Taskmaster breakdown** - For tasks requiring structured planning and tracking  
3. **Simple internal todos** - Only for trivial, single-step operations

## Product Requirements Document (PRD) Framework

### PRD Template Structure
```markdown
# [Feature Name] - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of the feature/project and its business value.

## Problem Statement
- What problem are we solving?
- Who experiences this problem?
- What is the impact of not solving it?

## Success Criteria
- How will we measure success?
- What are the key metrics?
- What does "done" look like?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**
   - Users must be able to create accounts with email/password
   - Email verification required before account activation
   - Password strength requirements enforced
   - Account creation rate limiting implemented

2. **Authentication**
   - Users must be able to log in with email/password
   - JWT token-based session management
   - Automatic logout after configurable timeout
   - "Remember me" functionality for extended sessions

3. **Password Management**
   - Users must be able to reset forgotten passwords
   - Secure password reset links via email
   - Password change functionality for logged-in users
   - Password history to prevent reuse

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Login process completes within 2 seconds
- **Security**: All passwords hashed with bcrypt (minimum 12 rounds)
- **Scalability**: System supports 10,000 concurrent users
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime requirement
- **Compliance**: GDPR compliant data handling

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Overview
- Microservice architecture with user service
- PostgreSQL database for user data storage
- Redis for session management and caching
- RESTful API with JWT authentication

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    email_verified_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Session termination
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Password reset completion

## Implementation Plan

- Database schema creation
- User registration endpoint
- Password hashing implementation
- Basic login/logout functionality

### Phase 2: Security Features (Week 3)
- Email verification system
- Password reset functionality
- Rate limiting implementation
- Security headers and validation

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Week 4)
- "Remember me" functionality
- Session management optimization
- Audit logging
- Performance optimization

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- User model validation
- Password hashing/verification
- JWT token generation/validation
- Input validation functions

### Integration Tests
- Database operations
- Email service integration
- Session management
- Rate limiting enforcement

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete registration flow
- Login/logout workflows
- Password reset process
- Security boundary testing

## Acceptance Criteria

### User Stories
1. **As a new user**, I want to create an account so that I can access the platform
   - User can enter email, password, and full name
   - System validates input and shows clear error messages
   - Email verification link is sent automatically
   - Account is created but inactive until email verification

2. **As a registered user**, I want to log into my account so that I can access my data
   - User can enter email and password
   - System authenticates and creates session
   - User is redirected to dashboard on success
   - Clear error messages shown for invalid credentials

3. **As a user who forgot their password**, I want to reset it so that I can regain access
   - User can request password reset with email
   - Secure reset link sent via email
   - User can set new password using reset link
   - Old password becomes invalid after reset

## Risks and Mitigation

### Security Risks
- **Brute force attacks**: Implement rate limiting and account lockout
- **Password exposure**: Use bcrypt with sufficient rounds, enforce strong passwords
- **Session hijacking**: Use secure, httpOnly cookies with proper expiration

### Technical Risks  
- **Database performance**: Implement connection pooling and query optimization
- **Email delivery**: Use reliable email service with fallback options
- **Session storage**: Use Redis cluster for high availability

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- Authentication response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Registration completion rate > 95%
- Password reset success rate > 90%

### Security Metrics
- Zero successful brute force attacks
- All passwords meet strength requirements
- No session-related security incidents

### User Experience Metrics
- User registration completion rate > 85%
- Login error rate < 5%
- Password reset abandonment rate < 20%
```

## Taskmaster AI Integration

### PRD to Taskmaster Workflow
1. **Create comprehensive PRD** following the template above
2. **Initialize Taskmaster project** with the PRD document
3. **Parse PRD into tasks** using Taskmaster's AI capabilities
4. **Analyze task complexity** and expand complex tasks into subtasks
5. **Track implementation progress** through Taskmaster's status system

### Taskmaster Configuration
```bash
# Initialize project with PRD
tm init --project-root /path/to/project

# Parse PRD into tasks
tm parse-prd --input .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt --num-tasks 0 --research

# Analyze complexity and expand tasks
tm analyze-complexity --threshold 5 --research
tm expand-all --research

# Track progress
tm next-task
tm set-status 1 in-progress
tm update-task 1 "Implementing user model with validation"
```

### Task Breakdown Strategy
```python
# Example: Complex task broken down by Taskmaster
Original Task: "Implement User Authentication System"

Subtasks Generated by Taskmaster:
1.1 Design and implement User model with validation
1.2 Create password hashing service with bcrypt
1.3 Implement JWT token service for session management
1.4 Create user registration endpoint with validation
1.5 Implement login endpoint with authentication
1.6 Add logout functionality and session cleanup
1.7 Create password reset request functionality
1.8 Implement password reset completion endpoint
1.9 Add email verification system
1.10 Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
1.11 Add comprehensive unit tests for auth services
1.12 Create integration tests for auth workflows
1.13 Implement E2E tests for complete user flows
```

## Simple Todo Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Simple Todos
Simple internal todos should **only** be used for:

```markdown
✅ Acceptable for Simple Todos:
- Single file edits (updating a configuration value)
- Adding a single import statement
- Fixing a typo or simple formatting issue
- Adding a simple comment or docstring
- Updating a version number
- Simple variable rename within one function

❌ Avoid Simple Todos For:
- Multi-file changes
- New feature implementation
- Bug fixes requiring investigation
- Performance optimization tasks
- Security-related changes
- Database schema changes
- API endpoint creation
- Complex refactoring
- Integration tasks
```

### Todo vs. Taskmaster Decision Tree
```
Is this task...
├── Affecting multiple files? → Use Taskmaster
├── Requiring research/analysis? → Use Taskmaster  
├── A new feature or capability? → Use PRD + Taskmaster
├── A complex bug fix? → Use Taskmaster
├── Security or performance related? → Use PRD + Taskmaster
├── Requiring testing strategy? → Use Taskmaster
└── Single file, trivial change? → Simple todo acceptable
```

## Research Integration

### Research-Driven Task Planning
Before creating PRDs or Taskmaster breakdowns, use research capabilities:

```bash
# Research best practices before PRD creation
tm research "authentication best practices JWT bcrypt security" --save-to-file

# Research architectural patterns for the domain
tm research "user authentication microservices architecture patterns" --task-ids 1,2,3

# Research specific implementation approaches
tm research "bcrypt vs argon2 password hashing comparison" --save-to 1.2
```

### Research Questions for PRDs
```markdown
Research areas to investigate before PRD finalization:
1. **Industry Standards**: What are current best practices for this domain?
2. **Security Considerations**: What are the latest security recommendations?
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: What are realistic performance targets?
4. **Architectural Patterns**: What proven patterns apply to this problem?
5. **Technology Choices**: What are the pros/cons of different implementation options?
6. **Compliance Requirements**: What regulations or standards must be met?
```
