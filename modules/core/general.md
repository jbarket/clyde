# General Coding Standards

## Code Quality Principles

### Readability
- Code is read more often than it's written
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Write self-documenting code
- Add comments only when necessary to explain "why", not "what"

### Consistency
- Follow established project conventions
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Apply consistent formatting
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns

### Simplicity
- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Avoid premature optimization
- Use the principle of least surprise
- Write code that's easy to understand and modify

## Naming Conventions

### Variables and Functions
- Use descriptive names that explain purpose
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood
- Use consistent verb/noun patterns
- Boolean variables should be questions (is_valid, has_permission)

### Classes and Modules
- Use nouns for class names
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Module names should be short and lowercase
- Package names should be lowercase with underscores

### Constants
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- Group related constants together
- Provide meaningful names over magic numbers
- Document purpose when not obvious

## Error Handling

### Exception Strategies
- Use exceptions for exceptional conditions
- Create domain-specific exception types
- Include meaningful error messages
- Log errors with sufficient context

### Defensive Programming
- Validate inputs at boundaries
- Use assertions for internal consistency
- Handle edge cases explicitly
- Fail fast for invalid states

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Guidelines
- Profile before optimizing
- Focus on algorithmic improvements first
- Consider memory usage and time complexity
- Optimize the critical path first

### Resource Management
- Close resources properly (files, connections)
- Use context managers when available
- Be mindful of memory leaks
- Clean up temporary resources

## Documentation

### Code Comments
- Explain complex algorithms
- Document non-obvious business rules
- Clarify performance trade-offs
- Update comments when code changes

### Function Documentation
- Document purpose and behavior
- Specify parameters and return values
- Include usage examples
- Document exceptions that may be raised

## Version Control

### Commit Practices
- Make small, focused commits
- Write clear commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

### Branch Management
- Use feature branches for development
- Keep branches short-lived
- Use descriptive branch names
- Regularly sync with main branch
