# Code Quality Standards

## When to Apply

- All code development and review activities
- Architecture and design decisions
- Refactoring and technical debt management
- Code review processes
- Performance optimization efforts

## Quality Dimensions

### 1. Readability
Code should be written for humans to understand:
- **Clear Naming**: Variables and functions describe their purpose
- **Consistent Style**: Follow established formatting conventions
- **Logical Structure**: Code flows in a logical, predictable manner
- **Appropriate Comments**: Explain "why" not "what"

### 2. Maintainability
Code should be easy to modify and extend:
- **Modular Design**: Separate concerns into distinct components
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between modules
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Documentation**: Keep design decisions and rationale documented

### 3. Reliability
Code should behave predictably and handle errors gracefully:
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management
- **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs
- **Edge Cases**: Handle boundary conditions explicitly
- **Defensive Programming**: Assume inputs may be invalid

### 4. Performance
Code should use resources efficiently:
- **Algorithm Choice**: Select appropriate algorithms for scale
- **Resource Management**: Properly manage memory, connections, files
- **Profiling-Driven**: Optimize based on measured bottlenecks
- **Scalability Awareness**: Consider performance under load

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Review Focus
Focus on: naming clarity, logical flow, error handling, security, performance.

### Refactoring Triggers
- **Complexity**: Functions/classes become too large or complex
- **Duplication**: Similar code patterns repeated
- **Clarity**: Code becomes hard to understand
- **Performance**: Measurable performance degradation
- **Maintenance**: Frequent bugs in the same area

### Quality Metrics
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Measure decision points in code
- **Code Coverage**: Percentage of code exercised by tests
- **Technical Debt**: Time required to fix quality issues
- **Bug Density**: Number of defects per unit of code
- **Code Churn**: Frequency of changes to code sections

## Examples

### Quality Examples
**Poor:** `def calc(x, y, op): return x/y if op=='div' else None`  
**Better:** Use descriptive names, type hints, proper error handling, and documentation for complex operations.

## Quality Practices

### Progressive Improvement
- **Incremental Refactoring**: Improve code quality in small steps
- **Quality Gates**: Set minimum standards for new code
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Maintain a backlog of quality issues
- **Regular Assessment**: Periodically review and improve standards

### Team Standards
- **Coding Guidelines**: Establish and document team conventions
- **Tool Integration**: Use linters, formatters, and analyzers
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Regular code reviews and pair programming
- **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated on best practices

### Automation
- **Static Analysis**: Automated code quality checks
- **Continuous Integration**: Quality gates in build pipeline
- **Test Automation**: Comprehensive automated test suites
- **Quality Monitoring**: Track quality metrics over time

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Premature Optimization**: Optimizing before identifying bottlenecks
- **Over-Engineering**: Adding complexity for hypothetical future needs
- **Copy-Paste Programming**: Duplicating code instead of abstracting
- **God Objects**: Classes or functions that do too many things
- **Magic Numbers**: Using unexplained constants throughout code
- **Ignored Warnings**: Dismissing compiler or linter warnings
