# Cognitive Framework for Complex Problem Solving

## Core Principle

A cognitive framework provides structured mental models and thinking patterns that enhance problem-solving capabilities by leveraging different cognitive approaches based on context and complexity.

## When to Apply

- Complex problems requiring multiple perspectives
- Situations where domain expertise is critical
- When creative and analytical thinking must be balanced
- Multi-stakeholder problems with competing priorities
- Technical decisions with significant long-term impact

## Cognitive Archetypes

### The Architect
**Mental Model**: Systems thinking and long-term vision
- Focus on structure, relationships, and scalability
- Consider future evolution and maintenance
- Balance competing technical and business requirements
- Think in terms of patterns and abstractions

**When to Apply**: System design, technology strategy, complex refactoring

### The Analyst
**Mental Model**: Data-driven investigation and logical reasoning
- Break problems into measurable components
- Seek empirical evidence for decisions
- Identify patterns in data and behavior
- Question assumptions with systematic inquiry

**When to Apply**: Performance optimization, debugging, requirements analysis

### The Creator
**Mental Model**: Innovative solution generation
- Explore unconventional approaches
- Combine existing concepts in new ways
- Prototype and experiment rapidly
- Embrace acceptable risk for breakthrough solutions

**When to Apply**: New feature development, solving novel problems, overcoming technical limitations

### The Optimizer
**Mental Model**: Efficiency and continuous improvement
- Focus on eliminating waste and bottlenecks
- Measure and iterate systematically
- Consider resource constraints and trade-offs
- Prioritize high-impact, low-effort improvements

**When to Apply**: Code optimization, process improvement, resource allocation

### The Guardian
**Mental Model**: Risk assessment and quality assurance
- Anticipate failure modes and edge cases
- Ensure security, reliability, and compliance
- Plan for disaster recovery and maintenance
- Balance safety with progress

**When to Apply**: Security reviews, testing strategy, production deployments

## Framework Application Process

### 1. Context Assessment
```
Questions to ask:
- What type of problem am I solving?
- What are the stakes and constraints?
- What expertise is most relevant?
- What perspective might I be missing?
```

### 2. Archetype Selection
- Choose primary archetype based on problem type
- Identify secondary perspectives that add value
- Consider switching archetypes as understanding evolves
- Use multiple archetypes for complex, multi-faceted problems

### 3. Perspective Integration
- Apply each selected archetype's mental model
- Look for conflicts and synergies between perspectives
- Synthesize insights into coherent approach
- Document reasoning from each perspective

## Examples

### Problem: Database Performance Issues

**Architect Perspective**:
- Is this a fundamental design problem?
- Should we consider different data models?
- How will this scale with future growth?
- What are the architectural trade-offs?

**Analyst Perspective**:
- What does the profiling data tell us?
- Which queries are slowest and why?
- What are the usage patterns?
- Are there measurable bottlenecks?

**Optimizer Perspective**:
- Which improvements give biggest impact?
- What's the cost/benefit of each solution?
- Can we optimize existing queries first?
- What's the minimum viable improvement?

**Guardian Perspective**:
- Will optimization changes affect data consistency?
- Are there security implications?
- What's our rollback plan?
- How will we monitor the changes?

### Problem: Feature Development Priority

**Creator Perspective**:
- What innovative solutions could differentiate us?
- Are there unexplored user needs we could address?
- What would a breakthrough solution look like?

**Analyst Perspective**:
- What does user data tell us about priorities?
- Which features drive engagement/retention?
- What are the measurable business impacts?

**Optimizer Perspective**:
- Which features can be built most efficiently?
- What's the development ROI for each option?
- Can we leverage existing components?

**Guardian Perspective**:
- What are the risks of each approach?
- Which features might introduce technical debt?
- What's our capacity for maintenance?

## Cognitive Switching Techniques

### Perspective Rotation
Deliberately cycle through different archetypes:
1. Spend 10 minutes thinking as Architect
2. Switch to Analyst for data-driven view
3. Apply Creator mindset for innovative options
4. Use Guardian lens for risk assessment
5. Synthesize insights from all perspectives

### Devil's Advocate
For each archetype, ask:
- "What would [Archetype] be most concerned about?"
- "What might [Archetype] see that others miss?"
- "How would [Archetype] approach this differently?"

### Constraint Reframing
- **Architect**: What if we had unlimited time?
- **Analyst**: What if we had perfect data?
- **Creator**: What if there were no technical limitations?
- **Optimizer**: What if resources were extremely limited?
- **Guardian**: What if failure was unacceptable?

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Single Archetype Bias**: Over-relying on your natural thinking style
- **Archetype Switching Too Fast**: Not spending enough time in each perspective
- **Perspective Paralysis**: Getting stuck trying to satisfy all viewpoints perfectly
- **Archetype Stereotyping**: Assuming archetypes are mutually exclusive
- **Context Ignorance**: Applying wrong archetype to situation

## Integration Benefits

- **Broader Solution Space**: Multiple perspectives reveal more options
- **Reduced Blind Spots**: Different archetypes catch different risks and opportunities
- **Better Stakeholder Communication**: Match communication style to audience perspective
- **Enhanced Team Collaboration**: Understand and leverage team members' natural thinking styles
- **More Robust Decisions**: Solutions that satisfy multiple valid perspectives are more likely to succeed

## Development Considerations

- Practice switching between archetypes consciously
- Develop comfort with each thinking style
- Learn to recognize which archetype a situation calls for
- Build teams with complementary cognitive strengths
- Create processes that engage multiple perspectives systematically
