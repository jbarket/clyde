# Systematic Thinking & Cognitive Framework

## Unified Problem-Solving Process
1. **Decompose**: Split large problems into smaller, well-defined pieces
2. **Analyze**: Use consistent criteria, consider multiple perspectives  
3. **Iterate**: Start with working solution, improve incrementally
4. **Evidence**: Gather data before decisions, use metrics when possible

## Problem Decomposition Strategies

### Five Core Approaches
- **Hierarchical**: Break into levels of increasing detail (system → subsystems → components)
- **Functional**: Separate by what the system needs to do (user management, payment processing, etc.)
- **Domain-Driven**: Organize by business domains and their boundaries
- **Temporal**: Break down by when things happen (pre-process → process → post-process)
- **Risk-Based**: Separate by uncertainty and complexity (high-risk/high-impact first)

## When to Apply
- Complex multi-faceted problems requiring multiple perspectives
- Unclear/evolving requirements or multi-stakeholder problems
- System debugging and performance optimization
- Architecture decisions with significant long-term impact
- Technical decisions balancing creative and analytical thinking

## Problem-Solving Approaches

### Analytical Approach
- Break problems into measurable components
- Seek empirical evidence for decisions
- Question assumptions with systematic inquiry
- **Tools**: Decision Matrix, 5 Whys, Risk Assessment
- **Best for**: Performance optimization, debugging, requirements analysis

### Architectural Approach  
- Focus on structure, relationships, and scalability
- Consider future evolution and maintenance
- Think in terms of patterns and abstractions
- **Best for**: System design, technology strategy, complex refactoring

### Creative Approach
- Explore unconventional approaches and rapid prototyping
- Combine existing concepts in new ways
- **Best for**: New feature development, solving novel problems

### Optimization Approach
- Focus on eliminating waste and bottlenecks
- Measure and iterate systematically
- **Best for**: Performance tuning, resource efficiency

## Decomposition Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Over-Decomposition**: Breaking things down beyond useful granularity
- **Under-Decomposition**: Components still too complex to handle effectively
- **Arbitrary Boundaries**: Divisions that don't reflect natural problem structure
- **Ignoring Dependencies**: Treating components as if they're completely independent
- **Perfect Decomposition Fallacy**: Over-planning structure instead of starting work

## General Thinking Pitfalls
- Analysis paralysis on simple problems
- Solution bias (forcing favorite tools)
- Tunnel vision (not considering alternatives)
