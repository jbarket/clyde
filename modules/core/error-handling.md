# Error Handling Philosophy


## Error Handling Strategies

### 1. Fail Fast
Detect and report errors as early as possible:
- **Input Validation**: Verify inputs at system boundaries
- **Configuration Validation**: Check settings at startup
- **Precondition Checks**: Validate assumptions before processing
- **Type Safety**: Use type systems to catch errors at compile time

### 2. Graceful Degradation
Continue operating with reduced functionality when possible:
- **Feature Toggling**: Disable non-critical features when dependencies fail
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provide alternative implementations
- **Caching**: Use cached data when live data unavailable
- **Default Values**: Provide sensible defaults when configuration fails

### 3. Error Recovery
Attempt to recover from transient failures:
- **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Timeouts**: Avoid hanging on unresponsive operations
- **Cleanup**: Ensure proper resource cleanup on failure

## Error Classification

### 1. User Errors
Mistakes made by users that should be handled gracefully with custom exceptions that include field names and actionable error messages.

### 2. System Errors
Infrastructure or dependency failures should be wrapped in custom exceptions that include service context and underlying cause.

### 3. Programming Errors
Bugs that indicate code defects should use assertions for precondition validation and fail fast.

## Implementation Patterns

### Error Context
Include error codes, context dictionaries, and relevant business data for debugging and monitoring.

### Resource Management
Use context managers and try/finally blocks to ensure proper cleanup of resources even when errors occur.

### Retry Logic
Implement exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures, with maximum attempts and delay limits.

## Error Communication

### User-Friendly Messages
Translate technical errors into actionable user feedback with appropriate error codes and clear messaging based on error type.

### Logging Strategy
Use appropriate log levels (error/debug) with context information and send critical errors to monitoring systems.

## Testing Error Conditions
Test error scenarios using mocks to simulate failures and verify proper error handling, recovery mechanisms, and error message content.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Error Metrics
Track error patterns to identify system issues:
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of operations that fail
- **Error Types**: Distribution of different error categories
- **Recovery Success**: How often retry logic succeeds
- **Error Duration**: How long errors persist

### Alerting Strategy
Alert on critical system errors, high error rates (>5%), and external service failures during business hours.

## Anti-patterns to Avoid

- **Silent Failures**: Catching exceptions without appropriate handling
- **Generic Exception Handling**: Catching all exceptions with same logic
- **Error Swallowing**: Losing important error information
- **Premature Recovery**: Retrying operations that will always fail
- **Error Message Leakage**: Exposing sensitive information in error messages
- **No Error Context**: Providing insufficient information for debugging
